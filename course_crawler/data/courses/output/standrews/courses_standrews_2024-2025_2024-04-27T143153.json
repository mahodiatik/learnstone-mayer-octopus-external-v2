Those on the MSc and PGDip will take five compulsory modules plus three optional modules. If you decide to take TESOL with a specialism, you must take one of your optional modules in that specialism. Those on the PGCert will take four modules of their choice. If you decide to take a PGCert with a specialism, you must take the module of your specialism plus three more modules.You will study each module for five weeks.In each module, you interact online in a weekly written discussion forum (or similar activity) with other postgraduate students in St Andrews and around the world, providing the opportunity to learn from peers living and working in a wide variety of contexts.While the programme does not include an assessed teaching placement or practicum, it supports students in exploring how theory can be applied to real-word situations, through:practical learning and assessment tasksmaterials development activities.TESOL specialismsAssessment and evaluationThis specialism is aimed at teachers with a particular interest in assessment and evaluation. Itopens up possibilities to work in a wide variety of academic settings, either writing assessment material or training those who write and deliver assessment and evaluation.Assessment is increasingly becoming part of English language teaching (ELT) pedagogy:mastery and active learning approaches use assessment tasks as learning taskslow-stakes testing is structuring engagement in online learningincreasingly, credential-oriented societies require teachers to make creative use of testing to support learning.A specialism in assessment and evaluation will support you to understand the development of the current testing culture in ELT, including reflecting on where teachers can work with or need to resist current developments.There is also a highly practical value to the specialism: assessment is often done poorly, in a hurry, and with little awareness of consequences. Being able to develop tests, create supporting materials, and train examiners are therefore prized skills for ELT practitioners.You will be able to experience and evaluate different types of assessment through the weekly coursework tasks.English for Academic Purposes (EAP)The EAP specialism gives students the opportunity to integrate the theory and practice of teaching English to speakers of other languages, with a particular focus on teaching academic English. It opens up possibilities to work as an EAP tutor, course designer or assessment specialist.EAP is a growing discipline, and English is considered the lingua franca of academia. There is a strong need for evidence-based training and development in the practical teaching skills needed for this diverse and dynamic field.You will be able to develop knowledge and skills in academic discourses, materials design and assessment of EAP.English Medium Instruction (EMI)The EMI specialism is aimed at teachers with a particular interest in English medium instruction. This is an aspect of education in English that is growing rapidly, offering various roles for English as a foreign language (EFL) and English for academic purposes (EAP) teachers. It opensup possibilities to work in any level of education, covering EFL and EAP, as well as teacher development and management. It is also beneficial to educators in any subjects area who work, or plan to work, with students who are users of English as an additional language.As a relatively new field of study, EMI can develop in many ways, giving opportunities for creativity and innovation, from primary to tertiary level study.Teaching Young LearnersThis specialism is aimed at teachers with a particular interest in teaching young learners. It opens uppossibilities to work in a variety of preschool, elementary and secondary level educational settings as a teacher or policy specialist.This degree aims to help you make connections between what you do on other modules in the context of teaching children or teenagers (from 4 to 18 years). Taking this specialism will provide you with a qualification that clearly highlights your knowledge and understanding of the needs and strengths of these age groups. This is advantageous as future employers can see immediately that you are more likely to be qualified for teaching in schools at any level.You will be able to produce a portfolio of four lessons for contexts which you can select yourself, giving room for creativity and a focus on your preferred age group.Technology for TeachingThis specialism gives students the opportunity to integrate the theory and practice of teaching English to speakers of other languages, with a particular focus on technology for teaching. Graduates with experience of technology for teaching are in demand in a wide variety of educational settings to enhance technology-led provision.This specialism is aimed at students who want to develop the pedagogical knowledge that underpins the application of technology in language classrooms. This is a transdisciplinary course drawing on sources from a variety of fields like education, psychology, sociology, design, ludology, linguistics, and philosophy.You will develop technical skills in a range of applications, such as data-driven learning, task-based learning, and game-based learning. You will also develop project management skills, using techniques from agile design and design thinking.The University of St Andrews operates on a flexible modular degree system by which degrees are obtained through the accumulation of credits.

If you decide to take a PGCert with a specialism, you must take the module of your specialism plus three more modules.You will study each module for five weeks.In each module, you interact online in a weekly written discussion forum (or similar activity) with other postgraduate students in St Andrews and around the world, providing the opportunity to learn from peers living and working in a wide variety of contexts.While the programme does not include an assessed teaching placement or practicum, it supports students in exploring how theory can be applied to real-word situations, through:practical learning and assessment tasksmaterials development activities.TESOL specialismsAssessment and evaluationThis specialism is aimed at teachers with a particular interest in assessment and evaluation. Itopens up possibilities to work in a wide variety of academic settings, either writing assessment material or training those who write and deliver assessment and evaluation.Assessment is increasingly becoming part of English language teaching (ELT) pedagogy:mastery and active learning approaches use assessment tasks as learning taskslow-stakes testing is structuring engagement in online learningincreasingly, credential-oriented societies require teachers to make creative use of testing to support learning.A specialism in assessment and evaluation will support you to understand the development of the current testing culture in ELT, including reflecting on where teachers can work with or need to resist current developments.There is also a highly practical value to the specialism: assessment is often done poorly, in a hurry, and with little awareness of consequences. Being able to develop tests, create supporting materials, and train examiners are therefore prized skills for ELT practitioners.You will be able to experience and evaluate different types of assessment through the weekly coursework tasks.English for Academic Purposes (EAP)The EAP specialism gives students the opportunity to integrate the theory and practice of teaching English to speakers of other languages, with a particular focus on teaching academic English.

        "about": "Course detailsTESOL programmes are run by the International Education Institute.HighlightsThe programme allows for flexible part-time study while working, but also provides plenty of opportunities for you to interact with both TESOL students in St Andrews and other online students.Integrate theory and practice – discuss theoretical concepts and frameworks in small groups and in online written forums and apply these through applied assessments.Interact with a global cohort of students, studying both in St Andrews and online, through module learning activities.Attend an optional two-week summer school in St Andrews focusing on dissertation preparation, and providing the opportunity to experience living and studying in St Andrews.Join experienced practitioners and scholars in the English language teaching community, with opportunities to be involved in ongoing professional development events and the annualEnglish for Academic Purposes (EAP) conference.The number of taught modules you will take depends on whether you are studying for the MSc, PGDip or PGCert. Those on the MSc and PGDip will take five compulsory modules plus three optional modules. If you decide to take TESOL with a specialism, you must take one of your optional modules in that specialism. Those on the PGCert will take four modules of their choice. If you decide to take a PGCert with a specialism, you must take the module of your specialism plus three more modules.You will study each module for five weeks.In each module, you interact online in a weekly written discussion forum (or similar activity) with other postgraduate students in St Andrews and around the world, providing the opportunity to learn from peers living and working in a wide variety of contexts.While the programme does not include an assessed teaching placement or practicum, it supports students in exploring how theory can be applied to real-word situations, through:practical learning and assessment tasksmaterials development activities.TESOL specialismsAssessment and evaluationThis specialism is aimed at teachers with a particular interest in assessment and evaluation. Itopens up possibilities to work in a wide variety of academic settings, either writing assessment material or training those who write and deliver assessment and evaluation.Assessment is increasingly becoming part of English language teaching (ELT) pedagogy:mastery and active learning approaches use assessment tasks as learning taskslow-stakes testing is structuring engagement in online learningincreasingly, credential-oriented societies require teachers to make creative use of testing to support learning.A specialism in assessment and evaluation will support you to understand the development of the current testing culture in ELT, including reflecting on where teachers can work with or need to resist current developments.There is also a highly practical value to the specialism: assessment is often done poorly, in a hurry, and with little awareness of consequences. Being able to develop tests, create supporting materials, and train examiners are therefore prized skills for ELT practitioners.You will be able to experience and evaluate different types of assessment through the weekly coursework tasks.English for Academic Purposes (EAP)The EAP specialism gives students the opportunity to integrate the theory and practice of teaching English to speakers of other languages, with a particular focus on teaching academic English. It opens up possibilities to work as an EAP tutor, course designer or assessment specialist.EAP is a growing discipline, and English is considered the lingua franca of academia. There is a strong need for evidence-based training and development in the practical teaching skills needed for this diverse and dynamic field.You will be able to develop knowledge and skills in academic discourses, materials design and assessment of EAP.English Medium Instruction (EMI)The EMI specialism is aimed at teachers with a particular interest in English medium instruction. This is an aspect of education in English that is growing rapidly, offering various roles for English as a foreign language (EFL) and English for academic purposes (EAP) teachers. It opensup possibilities to work in any level of education, covering EFL and EAP, as well as teacher development and management. It is also beneficial to educators in any subjects area who work, or plan to work, with students who are users of English as an additional language.As a relatively new field of study, EMI can develop in many ways, giving opportunities for creativity and innovation, from primary to tertiary level study.Teaching Young LearnersThis specialism is aimed at teachers with a particular interest in teaching young learners. It opens uppossibilities to work in a variety of preschool, elementary and secondary level educational settings as a teacher or policy specialist.This degree aims to help you make connections between what you do on other modules in the context of teaching children or teenagers (from 4 to 18 years). Taking this specialism will provide you with a qualification that clearly highlights your knowledge and understanding of the needs and strengths of these age groups. This is advantageous as future employers can see immediately that you are more likely to be qualified for teaching in schools at any level.You will be able to produce a portfolio of four lessons for contexts which you can select yourself, giving room for creativity and a focus on your preferred age group.Technology for TeachingThis specialism gives students the opportunity to integrate the theory and practice of teaching English to speakers of other languages, with a particular focus on technology for teaching. Graduates with experience of technology for teaching are in demand in a wide variety of educational settings to enhance technology-led provision.This specialism is aimed at students who want to develop the pedagogical knowledge that underpins the application of technology in language classrooms. This is a transdisciplinary course drawing on sources from a variety of fields like education, psychology, sociology, design, ludology, linguistics, and philosophy.You will develop technical skills in a range of applications, such as data-driven learning, task-based learning, and game-based learning. You will also develop project management skills, using techniques from agile design and design thinking.The University of St Andrews operates on a flexible modular degree system by which degrees are obtained through the accumulation of credits.

Those on the MSc and PGDip will take five compulsory modules plus three optional modules. If you decide to take TESOL with a specialism, you must take one of your optional modules in that specialism. Those on the PGCert will take four modules of their choice. If you decide to take a PGCert with a specialism, you must take the module of your specialism plus three more modules.You will study each module for five weeks.In each module, you interact online in a weekly written discussion forum (or similar activity) with other postgraduate students in St Andrews and around the world, providing the opportunity to learn from peers living and working in a wide variety of contexts.While the programme does not include a teaching placement or practicum, it supports students in exploring how theory can be applied to real-world situations, through:practical learning and assessment tasksmaterials development activitiesparticipation as a student in language classesa limited number of peer teaching activities.Outside of modular study, you are also offered the chance to apply for mentored teaching opportunities. In the current academic year, the International Education Institute has:mentored students in leadingAcademic English Serviceworkshopssupported students to present at our annual English for Academic Purposes conferenceengaged a number of students in supported assistant teacher roles on summer coursesoffered students the opportunity to teach refugees in the local community.TESOL specialismsAssessment and evaluationThis specialism is aimed at teachers with a particular interest in assessment and evaluation. Itopens up possibilities to work in a wide variety of academic settings, either writing assessment material or training those who write and deliver assessment and evaluation.Assessment is increasingly becoming part of English language teaching (ELT) pedagogy:mastery and active learning approaches use assessment tasks as learning taskslow-stakes testing is structuring engagement in online learningincreasingly, credential-oriented societies require teachers to make creative use of testing to support learning.A specialism in assessment and evaluation will support you to understand the development of the current testing culture in ELT, including reflecting on where teachers can work with or need to resist current developments.There is also a highly practical value to the specialism: assessment is often done poorly, in a hurry, and with little awareness of consequences. Being able to develop tests, create supporting materials, and train examiners are therefore prized skills for ELT practitioners.You will be able to experience and evaluate different types of assessment through the weekly coursework tasks.English for Academic Purposes (EAP)The EAP specialism gives students the opportunity to integrate the theory and practice of teaching English to speakers of other languages, with a particular focus on teaching academic English. It opens up possibilities to work as an EAP tutor, course designer or assessment specialist.EAP is a growing discipline, and English is considered the lingua franca of academia. There is a strong need for evidence-based training and development in the practical teaching skills needed for this diverse and dynamic field.You will be able to develop knowledge and skills in academic discourses, materials design and assessment of EAP.English Medium Instruction (EMI)The EMI specialism is aimed at teachers with a particular interest in English medium instruction. This is an aspect of education in English that is growing rapidly, offering various roles for English as a foreign language (EFL) and English for academic purposes (EAP) teachers. It opensup possibilities to work in any level of education, covering EFL and EAP, as well as teacher development and management. It is also beneficial to educators in any subjects area who work, or plan to work, with students who are users of English as an additional language.As a relatively new field of study, EMI can develop in many ways, giving opportunities for creativity and innovation, from primary to tertiary level study.Teaching Young LearnersThis specialism is aimed at teachers with a particular interest in teaching young learners. It opens uppossibilities to work in a variety of preschool, elementary and secondary level educational settings as a teacher or policy specialist.This degree aims to help you make connections between what you do on other modules in the context of teaching children or teenagers (from 4 to 18 years). Taking this specialism will provide you with a qualification that clearly highlights your knowledge and understanding of the needs and strengths of these age groups. This is advantageous as future employers can see immediately that you are more likely to be qualified for teaching in schools at any level.You will be able to produce a portfolio of four lessons for contexts which you can select yourself, giving room for creativity and a focus on your preferred age group.Technology for TeachingThis specialism gives students the opportunity to integrate the theory and practice of teaching English to speakers of other languages, with a particular focus on technology for teaching. Graduates with experience of technology for teaching are in demand in a wide variety of educational settings to enhance technology-led provision.This specialism is aimed at students who want to develop the pedagogical knowledge that underpins the application of technology in language classrooms. This is a transdisciplinary course drawing on sources from a variety of fields like education, psychology, sociology, design, ludology, linguistics, and philosophy.You will develop technical skills in a range of applications, such as data-driven learning, task-based learning, and game-based learning. You will also develop project management skills, using techniques from agile design and design thinking.The University of St Andrews operates on a flexible modular degree system by which degrees are obtained through the accumulation of credits.

        "description": "Our Sustainable Development programme addresses many of the most pressing developmental (environmental and social) challenges of the 21st century, equipping our students to evaluate diverse and contested ideas about what these challenges are and how best to solve them, as well as teaching the skills needed to develop these ideas in policy directions. We cover a breadth of environmental, social and economic issues, such as climate change, development, health, energy, policy change and conservation.",
        "about": "Course detailsYou will explore the tensions and synergies between different theories and approaches to sustainability, including forms of governance and decision-making. You will engage with sustainable development policy and practice at different scales (local, national, and international), and consider alternative frameworks and trajectories of sustainability - from broad-scale ecosystem approaches to decolonial agendas. Coursework components will help you to develop and demonstrate writing and analysis skills for different audiences. Optional modules allow you to explore topics such as capitalism and development, energy politics, and population change, which will further develop the interdisciplinary character of your studies.HighlightsIntroduces different conceptualizations of sustainability and enables students to navigate a contested (and urgent) field.Rooted in critical interdisciplinary social science, this course addresses social and political responses to climate science and offers a remarkable richness and depth compared with conventional single-subject degrees.Core courses first use Development and then Nature as entry points into Sustainable Development. We teach you to analyse academic concepts and debates before shifting focus to research-led policy.Our MSc focuses on the relationships between academia, policy, and society, and teaches writing for both academic and policy audiences.",

        "about": "Course detailsTESOL programmes are run by the International Education Institute.HighlightsIntegrate theory and practice – discuss theoretical concepts and frameworks in small groups and in online written forums and apply these through applied assessments.Interact with a global cohort of students, studying both in St Andrews and online, through module learning activities.Engage in and reflect on a new language learning experience to gain an all-around perspective on language teaching and learning.Access an optional and supplementary resource bank of material in parallel with your PGT programme to support both your learning and the development of your professional identity.Join experienced practitioners and scholars in the English language teaching community, with opportunities to be involved in ongoing professional development events and the annualEnglish for Academic Purposes (EAP) conference.The number of taught modules you will take depends on whether you are studying for the MSc, PGDip or PGCert degree. Those on the MSc and PGDip will take five compulsory modules plus three optional modules. If you decide to take TESOL with a specialism, you must take one of your optional modules in that specialism. Those on the PGCert will take four modules of their choice. If you decide to take a PGCert with a specialism, you must take the module of your specialism plus three more modules.You will study each module for five weeks.In each module, you interact online in a weekly written discussion forum (or similar activity) with other postgraduate students in St Andrews and around the world, providing the opportunity to learn from peers living and working in a wide variety of contexts.While the programme does not include a teaching placement or practicum, it supports students in exploring how theory can be applied to real-world situations, through:practical learning and assessment tasksmaterials development activitiesparticipation as a student in language classesa limited number of peer teaching activities.Outside of modular study, you are also offered the chance to apply for mentored teaching opportunities. In the current academic year, the International Education Institute has:mentored students in leadingAcademic English Serviceworkshopssupported students to present at our annual English for Academic Purposes conferenceengaged a number of students in supported assistant teacher roles on summer coursesoffered students the opportunity to teach refugees in the local community.TESOL specialismsAssessment and evaluationThis specialism is aimed at teachers with a particular interest in assessment and evaluation. Itopens up possibilities to work in a wide variety of academic settings, either writing assessment material or training those who write and deliver assessment and evaluation.Assessment is increasingly becoming part of English language teaching (ELT) pedagogy:mastery and active learning approaches use assessment tasks as learning taskslow-stakes testing is structuring engagement in online learningincreasingly, credential-oriented societies require teachers to make creative use of testing to support learning.A specialism in assessment and evaluation will support you to understand the development of the current testing culture in ELT, including reflecting on where teachers can work with or need to resist current developments.There is also a highly practical value to the specialism: assessment is often done poorly, in a hurry, and with little awareness of consequences. Being able to develop tests, create supporting materials, and train examiners are therefore prized skills for ELT practitioners.You will be able to experience and evaluate different types of assessment through the weekly coursework tasks.English for Academic Purposes (EAP)The EAP specialism gives students the opportunity to integrate the theory and practice of teaching English to speakers of other languages, with a particular focus on teaching academic English. It opens up possibilities to work as an EAP tutor, course designer or assessment specialist.EAP is a growing discipline, and English is considered the lingua franca of academia. There is a strong need for evidence-based training and development in the practical teaching skills needed for this diverse and dynamic field.You will be able to develop knowledge and skills in academic discourses, materials design and assessment of EAP.English Medium Instruction (EMI)The EMI specialism is aimed at teachers with a particular interest in English medium instruction. This is an aspect of education in English that is growing rapidly, offering various roles for English as a foreign language (EFL) and English for academic purposes (EAP) teachers. It opensup possibilities to work in any level of education, covering EFL and EAP, as well as teacher development and management. It is also beneficial to educators in any subjects area who work, or plan to work, with students who are users of English as an additional language.As a relatively new field of study, EMI can develop in many ways, giving opportunities for creativity and innovation, from primary to tertiary level study.Teaching Young LearnersThis specialism is aimed at teachers with a particular interest in teaching young learners. It opens uppossibilities to work in a variety of preschool, elementary and secondary level educational settings as a teacher or policy specialist.This degree aims to help you make connections between what you do on other modules in the context of teaching children or teenagers (from 4 to 18 years). Taking this specialism will provide you with a qualification that clearly highlights your knowledge and understanding of the needs and strengths of these age groups. This is advantageous as future employers can see immediately that you are more likely to be qualified for teaching in schools at any level.You will be able to produce a portfolio of four lessons for contexts which you can select yourself, giving room for creativity and a focus on your preferred age group.Technology for TeachingThis specialism gives students the opportunity to integrate the theory and practice of teaching English to speakers of other languages, with a particular focus on technology for teaching. Graduates with experience of technology for teaching are in demand in a wide variety of educational settings to enhance technology-led provision.This specialism is aimed at students who want to develop the pedagogical knowledge that underpins the application of technology in language classrooms. This is a transdisciplinary course drawing on sources from a variety of fields like education, psychology, sociology, design, ludology, linguistics, and philosophy.You will develop technical skills in a range of applications, such as data-driven learning, task-based learning, and game-based learning. You will also develop project management skills, using techniques from agile design and design thinking.The University of St Andrews operates on a flexible modular degree system by which degrees are obtained through the accumulation of credits.

It offers an advanced grounding in the security of three fascinating and turbulent regions: the Middle East, Caucasus and Central Asia. It explores the security, politics, economics, history and culture of these strategically significant areas.HighlightsThe course is designed as a prelude to professional work in diplomacy, government, NGOs, or international business or as a preparation for PhD study.In most years, the MECCASS teaching staff conduct a study trip for students to either Central Asia or the Middle East, offering unique insights (these trips depend on staff availability and conditions on ground, and cannot, therefore be guaranteed to be available every year; they are funded by participating students).The course offers an opportunity for language study in Arabic, Persian or Russian on undergraduate levels.Teaching is deeply informed with real-world experience as the programme regularly brings in practitioners and outside experts.is deeply informed with real-world experience as the programme regularly brings in practitioners and outside experts.ModulesThe modules published below are examples of what has been taught in previous academic years and may be subject to change before you start your programme. For more details of each module, including weekly contact hours, teaching methods and assessment, please see themodule catalogue.All students taking the Middle East, Caucasus and Central Asian Security Studies MLitt take one compulsory and one optional module in Semester 1 and two optional modules in Semester 2.The modules in this programme have varying methods of delivery and assessment.CompulsoryOptionalLanguage trackDissertationAll students must take the following compulsory module:Core in Middle East, Caucasus and Central Asian Security Studies:focuses on major themes in the study of international security and applies them to the study of the Middle East, Caucasus and Central Asia.Students pick three optional modules. Unless students pursue a language track, they are expected to take at least one of their optional modules in the Middle East subject area, and one optional module in the Caucasus or Central Asia subject areas.Here is a sample of optional modules that may be offered:Central Asia in World OrderConflict and Peace in Post-Communist EurasiaConflict in the Middle EastConflict, Security and Democracy in the Greater Caucasus (30)Contemporary Gulf Politics in a Changing Global ContextInternational Relations of the Modern Middle EastInternational Society and Central AsiaIran and the World since 1921Political Order and Violence in the Middle EastThe Israeli-Palestinian ConflictOptional modules are subject to change each year and require a minimum number of participants to be offered; some may only allow limited numbers of students (see the University's position oncurriculum development).Those doing a language track have an option to take, in place of one of the above modules, undergraduate language modules chosen from Russian, Arabic or Persian. These modules depend on staff availability and timetabling compatibility, and cannot, therefore be guaranteed to be available every year.The final element of the MLitt is a 15,000-word dissertation. The dissertation should focus on an area of Middle East, Caucasus and Central Asian security studies in which you are interested. Each student is supported by a relevant supervisor from the School who will advise on the choice of subject and provide guidance throughout the research process. The completed dissertation must be submitted by the end of August.If students choose not to complete the dissertation requirement for the MLitt, there is an exit award available that allows suitably qualified candidates to receive a Postgraduate Diploma. By choosing an exit award, you will finish your degree at the end of the second semester of study and receive a PGDip instead of an MLitt.",

        "about": "Course detailsHealthcare is being transformed by digital technologies and big data analytics. On the MSc in Health Data Science, you will explore the principles and practice of digital health implementation.HighlightsAimed at students intending to follow a career in data science and digital health.Interdisciplinary character helps you to develop a more rounded understanding of digital health questions and concepts.Applied components provide practical skills in medical data analysis and the use of digital technologies to address healthcare challenges.Links with the Sir James Mackenzie Institute for Early Diagnosis bring you into contact with current digital health research across different disciplines.We are introducing a fully-funded PhD in 2024, which is available exclusively for our Health Data Science students to apply for.The MSc in Health Data Science is distinguished by its interdisciplinary character and an emphasis on applied skills that will be of particular value if you are looking to follow a career in digital health.Digital technology is transforming healthcare. It is enabling faster diagnosis and better treatment of illnesses, supporting improvements in patient care, and making healthcare settings more efficient. That transformation is creating a need for professionals who understand existing medical technologies and who have the skills and expertise to develop new technologies, analyse medical data, and inform policy on medical data analytics. Students from the MSc in Health Data Science will be able to fill those roles.On the MSc you will learn about the theoretical underpinnings of digital health. You will look at different forms of health data, the technology that generate them, methods used for processing and analysis, and how digital data is integrated in clinical decision making. In particular, you will develop an appreciation of the challenges in handling, storing and analysing big data in healthcare contexts.An understanding of these principles provides a basis for studying the practical applications of digital health and developing your understanding of how digital health concepts can be applied to solve real-world medical problems. You will learn practical skills in medical data analysis and the use of digital technologies to address healthcare challenges. You will develop your understanding of techniques for programmatically processing medical data such as genetic data, medical images, and patient vital signs. You will also learn about digital health governance and the ethical considerations that can arise when designing and executing medical data analysis studies.Particular attention is paid to training in medical image analysis, bioinformatics and modelling and analysis of medical data such as patient records. Theoretical learning is applied to real-world case studies, and you will develop an understanding of practitioner and industry perspectives and the work that is needed across academia and other sectors to advance digital health. More broadly, you will develop practical skills in explaining digital health concepts to different audiences and the translation of academic thinking on digital into recommendations for policymakers and practitioners.Digital health is inherently interdisciplinary. This MSc brings together academic staff, National Health Service (NHS) colleagues, and industrial partners providing a greater breadth of learning that encompasses real clinical problems as well as the solutions that digital health can provide.In this way you will engage with critical perspectives on digital health principles and practice. You will be encouraged to develop a more rounded, interdisciplinary understanding of digital health questions and concepts. Through research-led teaching from scholars working in subjects including computer science, medicine, and statistics you will gain an appreciation of the technical, clinical, and analytical aspects of digital health and learn how to critically discuss digital health solutions from multiple disciplinary perspectives.Optional modules allow you to explore topics such as knowledge discovery and datamining that will broaden your learning in key areas and further develop the interdisciplinary character of your studies.The MSc in Health Data Science has close links with theSir James Mackenzie Institute for Early Diagnosis. The Institute brings together researchers from a range of disciplines and builds on St Andrews’ international reputation in digital diagnosis, health data research, and biophotonics. These links will bring you into contact with current digital health research, giving your studies a remarkable richness and depth.",

This MLitt compares social and political thought that originated in different regions at various points in history, but you will also consider what connects these traditions and how different intellectual lineages form a shared commons for all of us.You will develop your understanding of global intellectual history while being encouraged to question its sometimes arbitrary categories. You will also learn to look at theory beyond Eurocentric lenses. In doing so you will think critically about how an awareness of multiple theoretical traditions can help us to respond to global issues such as social injustice, economic exploitation, ideological conflicts, and environmental degradation.Your learning will include key debates in contemporary global politics – from issues of democracy and rights within states to questions of international law and global justice between states. You will be trained to critically interpret political discussions through the optics of race, ethnicity, class, and gender. The MLitt asks how we can think in common with diverse societies and cultures to create a more democratic and equal world. You will be encouraged to consider the perspectives of the marginalised – the impoverished, the minority, or the refugee – and to think, in terms of practical solutions on the level of policy and research, about ways to democratise and subalternise global politics.The MLitt is distinctively interdisciplinary. On this MLitt subject, experts from across the University provide their own disciplinary perspectives on key topics. Through research-led teaching from scholars working in subjects including history, international relations, classics, literary-cultural studies, and biology you will learn to analyse contemporary debates and compare how these are approached from anthropological, historical, environmental, and philosophical perspectives.You will be encouraged to develop a more rounded, interdisciplinary understanding of global thought traditions and learn how to critically discuss these traditions from multiple disciplinary perspectives. You will also demonstrate your ability to solve complex problems by critical understanding, analysis, and synthesis.The MLitt will be of particular interest if you intend to continue to doctoral research as it provides a broad-based programme of study culminating in a supervised research project.",

For more details of each module, including weekly contact hours, teaching methods and assessment, please see themodule catalogue.CompulsoryOptionalResearch projectAnalytical Methods in Geochemistry: trains students in the advanced techniques and methodologies used to address fundamental and applied questions related to the Earth system.Geochemistry: covers the origin and distribution of the elements, thermodynamics, redox reactions and aqueous geochemistry.Geochemistry Field Excursion: covers best practice field skills in documenting the geological and environmental controls in a geochemical problem, how to collect samples, perform geochemical analyses in the field and present data in a written report.Isotope Geochemistry:Theory, Techniques, and Applications: explores the theory behind, and geochemical applications of, the natural variability measurable in both radiogenic and stable isotope systems.Research Project:involves project formulation, proposal writing and analytical design, as well as data integration and interpretation. The results are presented as oral presentations, as a poster as part of a conference, and in a dissertation.Special Topics in Geochemistry: reviews current 'hot topic' research about how our planet has evolved and some of the major changes in its chemistry, biosphere and climate.Statistics and Analytical Sciences: provides students with a strong background in statistics and methods of data analysis used in Earth Sciences.Students choose up to three optional modules.Here is a sample of optional modules that may be offered.Advanced Physical Inorganic Chemistry: focuses on advanced discussion of theproperties of selected main group compounds, spectroscopy and magnetism.Blockbuster Solids: focuses on how material structure influences its electrical, magnetic and thermal properties, with emphasis placed on metal-organic frameworks and how they can be used for the storage and release of gases.Coding and Modelling in Earth Sciences:focuses on building understanding of fundamental concepts in scientific coding, gaining practical coding experience using the popular Python language and then the application of computer models to gain insight into topics across the Earth Sciences.Core to Crust Ore Genesis – High Temperature: focuses on the geological processes, geodynamic setting, and mineralogy of the principal metallic and non-metallic mineral deposits related to magmatic and magmatic-hydrothermal processes.Core to Crust Ore Genesis – Low Temperature:focuses on the geological processes, geodynamic setting, and mineralogy of the principal metallic and non-metallic mineral deposits related to low-temperature hydrothermal and surficial processes.Energy Conversion and Storage: discusses the technical details and environmental applications of electrochemical technologies for energy storage, such as batteries and fuel cells.Evolution and dynamics of the silicate Earth: explores the nature of the acid and basic magmatism that creates the Earth's crust, the petrography and geochemistry of minerals and rocks, and the petrogenesis and evolution of magmas and metamorphic rocks.Global Resource Challenges:tackles the economic, environmental, societal, geopolitical and ethical issues regarding mining, and future challenges shaping mineral exploration into the mid-21st century. It includes field trips to see the environmental impact of mining.Homogeneous Catalysis: demonstrates the links between catalyst structure, performance, commercial utilisation and sustainability.Pollution and aqueous chemistry: provides a combination of the underpinning hydrological theory and the analytical tools required to better understand and ameliorate problems of water in the environment.Processing of Materials: focuses on the processing of materials and fundamental materials properties such as crystallinity, composition, crystal phase, phase mixing, domain structure, grains and grain boundaries, porosity and pore structure.The Chemistry of the Solar System: explores established and cutting-edge theories which help explain the processes that determined the chemical compositions of the pre-solar nebula, our Sun, and the planets and asteroids.Optional modules are subject to change each year and require a minimum number of participants to be offered; some may only allow limited numbers of students (see the University's position on curriculum development).The third semester of the MSc course focuses on independent laboratory-based (or field and laboratory-based) research conducted with an academic supervisor. The topic is defined by the student and can be chosen from research foci within the School, or with an external industrial or academic partner.The research project will involve:background literature reviewproject formulationproposal writing and analytical designdata integration and interpretation.Students present the results of their project as an oral presentation,at a poster conference and in a dissertation. The completed dissertation of not more than 15,000 words must be submitted by a date towards the end of August.If students choose not to complete the dissertation requirement for the MSc, there is an exit award available that allows suitably qualified candidates to receive a Postgraduate Diploma. By choosing an exit award, you will finish your degree at the end of the second semester of study and receive a PGDip instead of an MSc.",

In this course, you will explore these questions by studying gender theory and by critically examining contemporary debates on gender issues.HighlightsIntroduces key topics in gender studies.Its interdisciplinary character helps you develop a more rounded understanding of gender studies questions and of its key questions and concepts.Prepares you for further academic study and research.Well-established links with the vibrant and diverse academic community at St Andrews will bring you into contact with current gender studies research across different disciplines.The MLitt in Gender Studies is distinguished by its interdisciplinary character and by an emphasis on an intersectional understanding of gender.You will be taught by experts drawn from a pool of 100 academics from 17 academic Schools across the University providing distinctive disciplinary perspectives on key topics in gender studies, including gender theory, masculinities, queer theory, and trans theory.This will enable you to develop a well-rounded, interdisciplinary understanding of gender studies and the ability to solve complex problems by critical understanding, analysis, and synthesis.The degree provides a broad programme of study culminating in a supervised research project. It will thus be of particular interest if you intend to progress to doctoral research. It will equip you with a range of essential skills that are highly valued in a variety of professional contexts (e.g. journalism, media studies, social work, advocacy work).",

For more details of each module, including weekly contact hours, teaching methods and assessment, please see themodule catalogue.CompulsoryOptionalLanguage modulesDissertationThemes and Methods in Classical Research 1: focuses on the sources for the study of the classical world, how to access them (that is, the resources available for classical research), and how to use this material sensitively and appropriately.Themes and Methods in Classical Research 2: a series of seminars structured around themes in classical research (e.g. the environment, performance, reception).Classics students have the opportunity to choose two of the following five overarching modules, one per semester. These modules are designed to give you both a familiarity with the key debates in a given subject area and the opportunity to develop a topic of your own choice with one-to-one supervision. The choice of modules allows you flexibility to develop a range of pathways and to focus, for example, on history, literary culture, philosophy or archaeology, or to focus on Greek or Roman history and literature in combination.Semester 1 (choose one)Greek History and Material CultureLatin Literary CultureSemester 2 (choose one)Greek Literary CultureRoman History and Material CultureThemes in Greek and Roman PhilosophyOptional modules are subject to change each year and require a minimum number of participants to be offered; some may only allow limited numbers of students (see the University’s position oncurriculum development).All students have the opportunity to study Greek or Latin from beginners’ level, or to improve their language skills through more advanced language courses.Students who take Greek or Latin language modules take alternative versions of the optional modules which follow the same course of study but with a reduced workload and fewer credits.Each student undertakes a dissertation of 15,000 words on a specialist subject chosen in consultation with the MLitt convenor and a dedicated supervisor who is responsible for guiding you through the research process and commenting on draft sections. The completed dissertation must be submitted by mid-August.If students choose not to complete the dissertation requirement for the MLitt, there is an exit award available that allows suitably qualified candidates to receive a Postgraduate Diploma. By choosing an exit award, you will finish your degree at the end of the second semester of study and receive a PGDip instead of a MLitt.",
